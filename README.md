# 05_MatPlotLib
## Overview

This repository contains a main file and two correlating files with CSV files for analyzing and summarizing CSV data into the Jupyter Notebook file. The directions for the module were to create a jupyter file, including a resources folder (for storing the original CSV file), and using the CSV files to merge and complete a final analysis of cancer drug regimens of the data for this challenge.

**I believe that there is a discrepancy in the original file which I wish to point out. The original file had data stating that male to female ratios were 51% to 49% respectively, which I do agree if the original had used the clean dataframe with the original timepoints (multiple timepoints) in the data. This slightly skews the data and is not entirely correct. If we are summarily counting 248 mice, we must use one mouse ID, eliminating additional timepoints. This data then reflects more accurately as 50.4% to 49.6%, Male to Female respectively. 

## Results

In the 05_MatplotLib_Challenge, this dataset is an analysis 248 unique mice using 10 different anti-cancer medications, tracking comparison of various timepoints and tumor volumes. The analysis further breaks down individual mouse gender, as well as days of treatment and weight of mouse and tumor volume with the drug remgimen Capomulin.

## Usage

You can use this file to analyze the data in the corresponding resource CSV's.

1. Open the respective file (`Pymaceuticals.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook.

2. Make sure that the resource and analysis directories are congruent within their respective places as listed in the script, if not change the location.

3. Run individual cells within the (`Pymaceuticals.ipynb) to see the calculations of breakdown by category.

4. The results will be displayed in the terminal.
